## 🌌 The Problem: Digital Chaos
You start with one tab. Then five. Then fifty.
Your browser becomes a cluttered mess of unread articles, half-finished tasks, and forgotten research.
**This is cognitive load**. It drains your battery, slows your computer, and—most importantly—scatters your focus.

## 🚀 The Solution: MindTab
MindTab isn't just a tab manager. It's an **intelligent workspace companion** that understands your browsing habits and organizes your digital life for you.

Using **Next-Gen On-Device AI (Gemini Nano)**, MindTab reads your tabs, understands context, and groups them into logical clusters—instantly.

### ✨ Premium Features
*   **🧠 AI-Powered Grouping**: One click to transform chaos into order. MindTab analyzes page titles and URLs to create meaningful groups like "Research," "Shopping," or "Dev Work."
*   **💬 Chat with Your Browser**: Ask questions like *"What was that article about React hooks I opened?"* or *"Summarize the flight options I'm looking at."* MindTab answers using the content of your active tabs.
*   **🔒 Privacy by Default**: No data leaves your machine. MindTab uses Chrome's built-in AI model, ensuring your browsing history stays yours.
*   **⚡ Zero-Latency Performance**: Optimized for speed. Group 100+ tabs in milliseconds without hogging memory.
*   **🎨 Beautiful Design**: A sleek, dark-mode-first interface that feels like a natural extension of your browser.
